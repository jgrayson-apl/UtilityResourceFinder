## Demo
[Utility Resource Finder](https://apl.bd.esri.com/Platform/UtilityResourceFinder/index.html)

This story addresses a response to a damage report of a fallen electric distribution pole that has impacted 2 major customers. Using Esriâ€™s location services in this web app, the dispatcher can find the closest available field engineer to send and a nearby utility warehouse to pick up supplies on the way in the safest way possible.
